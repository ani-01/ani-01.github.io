    <h1>Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are a powerful combination for automating tasks inside and outside of the factory setting. In recent years, AI has become an increasingly common presence in robotic solutions, introducing flexibility and learning capabilities in previously rigid applications.

While AI is still in its nascent stages, itâ€™s been a transformative technology for some applications in the manufacturing sector, although there are many that have yet to feel the impact.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:#FFA8B6;">WILL AN AI STEAL YOUR JOB?</h2>
    <P style="background-color:#FFA8B6;">
      The possibility of artificially intelligent systems replacing much of modern manual labour is perhaps a more credible near-future possibility.
      While AI won't replace all jobs, what seems to be certain is that AI will change the nature of work, with the only question being how rapidly and how profoundly automation will alter the workplace.<br>
      There is barely a field of human endeavour that AI doesn't have the potential to impact. As AI expert Andrew Ng puts it: "many people are doing routine, repetitive jobs. Unfortunately, technology is especially good at automating routine, repetitive work", saying he sees a "significant risk of technological unemployment over the next few decades".

      <br>

      Fully autonomous self-driving vehicles aren't a reality yet, but by some predictions the self-driving trucking industry alone is poised to take over 1.7 million jobs in the next decade, even without considering the impact on couriers and taxi drivers.
      Yet some of the easiest jobs to automate won't even require robotics. At present there are millions of people working in administration, entering and copying data between systems, chasing and booking appointments for companies. As software gets better at automatically updating systems and flagging the information that's important, so the need for administrators will fall.

      <br>

      As with every technological shift, new jobs will be created to replace those lost. However, what's uncertain is whether these new roles will be created rapidly enough to offer employment to those displaced, and whether the newly unemployed will have the necessary skills or temperament to fill these emerging roles.
      <br>

      Not everyone is a pessimist. For some, AI is a technology that will augment, rather than replace, workers. Not only that but they argue there will be a commercial imperative to not replace people outright, as an AI-assisted worker think a human concierge with an AR headset that tells them exactly what a client wants before they ask for it will be more productive or effective than an AI working on its own.
      Among AI experts there's a broad range of opinion about how quickly artificially intelligent systems will surpass human capabilities.
      <br>

      Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute asked several hundred machine-learning experts to predict AI capabilities, over the coming decades.
      Notable dates included AI writing essays that could pass for being written by a human by 2026, truck drivers being made redundant by 2027, AI surpassing human capabilities in retail by 2031, writing a best-seller by 2049, and doing a surgeon's work by 2053.
      They estimated there was a relatively high chance that AI beats humans at all tasks within 45 years and automates all human jobs within 120 years.
